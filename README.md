# CSE210 Student Repository
Bryce Pavlakos - CSE 210 Projects

This repository contains all the work I published to github for the BYU-I course CSE210: Programming with classes. 

CSE210: Programming with Classes is a course that focuses on the Principles of Classes, Objects, Polymorphism, and inheritance. It also introduces us to the basics of C#, configuring VS Code for C#, and using both "git" and "github" to collaborate with a team.

Information about the template I used:
The template contained the starter code for many different projects. The starter code is arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.
